                        <p><strong>As Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah,</strong></p>
                        <p>My dear ICSB Professional Colleagues, Interns, Students, and ICSB officers and staffs! Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm!” I keep this mantra above my desk as a reminder to be enthusiastic about the works ahead. Those words act as a cheer-leader for me on days when I cannot bear any more bad news. They motivate me when I feel stuck or burned out as we collectively pull through. My hope is that they will set the tone for my presidency with the ICSB, which began this month. It is a privilege to lead such an outstanding institution of higher learning and professionalism. The Institute to be rated a “Best Value” Institute by the Society we all live in.</p>
                        <p>I, on my own behalf and behalf of my Council Members express my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to the Hon’ble Members for electing us as the Council Members of ICSB for the term 2022-25. I also express my gratitude to the Council Members for electing me as the President of the Institute for the Term 2022-25. I have observed that a large number of young members unitedly came forward to give their sacred verdict for the development of the ICSB profession in the 5th ICSB election to materialize their hopes and aspirations which had been pending for a long time. With great heart and belief, I call upon all members of the Council and also the members of ICSB to come forward to work together for the development of our beloved ICSB profession to a centre of excellence in national and international level. Insha Allah, I committed myself to perform the responsibility reposed to me as President of ICSB with honesty, sincerity and dignity as in the past to materialize the dream of Hon’ble members to bring the institute to a new height, although it is very challenging for us considering the national and international economic turmoil. Please pray for me to Almighty Allah for my long life and good health to sacrifice myself for the wellbeing of the Members of ICSB.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our sound curriculum is led by distinguished faculty who are experts in their fields and value teaching. Our programs/courses from foundation level to advanced professional level prepare students for jobs in the regional economy, while our courses help students develop critical thinking, teamwork skills, and effective communication that employers increasingly demand for all level of employees. Curriculum, internships, global experiences, and research projects offer our students to acquire wider experiences outside the classroom. We prepare students for work and higher-level education and research programs and encourage them to remain abreast with the latest knowledge of their area of expertise. We’ve been a part of the fabric of the greater community since our journey started in 1997. Our collaborations with partners in the government, education, health care, business, the nonprofit sector and cultural institutions have strengthened us and the communities we serve. Our strategic alliance with the international institutions is an example of the kind of partnerships that exemplify our innovation.
                        </p>
                        <p>The students are the most important persons in our campus. We create opportunities and inspire students to achieve their goals. We recognize that in addition to our students’ academic pursuits, they need good lives and our support. Yet, ICSB offers more than just a great learning experience. It broadens horizons and challenges assumptions. So many of our students find that the public mission of ICSB seeps in, and changes them, in ways that help them make their way in the world, and in turn make the world a better place.
                        </p>
                        <p>Your valuable suggestions and cooperation for the betterment of ICSB is always welcome and will stand as a shining milestone! I encourage you to visit our campus and learn more about the opportunities available for you at ICSB.</p>
